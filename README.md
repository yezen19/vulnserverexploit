# vulnserverexploit
Buffer overflow exploit for vulnserver, including a simple spike fuzzing script, feel free to use.
Steps i took are going to be explained within .py file comments.

I'll include Vulnserver.exe too, for anyone that wants to practise. Use Immunity Debugger and a linux distro of your choice, as you'll probably be working in a terminal.

Please use mona.py, unless you want grey hairs.
